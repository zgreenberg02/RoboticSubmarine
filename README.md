<br /><br />

As a Mechanical Engineering Co-Lead, responsibilities included development and integration of mechanical systems, overseeing the integration of electrical components into the vehicle, and addressing interdisciplinary challenges. Key accomplishments: <br /><br />

### Backplate and Frame Fabrication:
Produced aluminum frame components and backplate using waterjet cutting and CNC milling to create a robust and modular structure. The backplate with its motor/sensor connections was designed with waterproofing features to ensure reliability, including sealing removable components to prevent water ingress. <br />
