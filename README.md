As a Mechanical Engineering Co-Lead, responsibilities included development and integration of mechanical systems, overseeing the integration of electrical components into the vehicle, and addressing interdisciplinary challenges. Key accomplishments: <br /><br />

### Backplate and Frame Fabrication:
Produced aluminum frame components and backplate using waterjet cutting and CNC milling to create a robust and modular structure. The backplate with its motor/sensor connections was designed with waterproofing features to ensure reliability, including sealing removable components to prevent water ingress. <br />

<br />

### Heat Dissipation Solutions:
Designed integrated thermal management systems, ensuring efficient heat transfer from internal components such as the Jetson computer and the electronic speed controllers.<br />

### Subsystem Development:
Contributed to the design of advanced systems, including a telescopic cascading elevator lift with a gripper, self-propelling torpedoes, and external battery enclosures.<br /><br />

Weekly pool tests are conducted to validate system performance, refine mechanical components, and enhance autonomous navigation capabilities.
